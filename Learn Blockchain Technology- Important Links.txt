These are the few links and sources to learn about the blockchain technology. These were the ones that I found a bit effective, but there are a lot many other sources we can refer to.  You can start with some short warm-up videos to get an insight of what exactly the blockchain technology is. These will help building your interest and can urge you to learn and explore more:
1. What is open and distributed ledger and how blockchain works:

Time to go in details.  
i) Cryptography is one of the core concepts in building the blockchain technology. It is used to secure the messages and the information that are send across the distributed network. It is also one of the main tools used in the Proof-of-Work algorithm. To learn more about it you can refer to this course in coursera:

ii) To learn about crytpography, blockchains, bitcoins and many other concepts in an elaborate way you can refer to these detailed lectures on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency (12 lectures series):

Smart contract is another interesting concept in this domain. They are basically computer programs stored in the blockchain and can execute on their own. They are used to make decentralized applications, a.k.a. DAPPs. Get an idea of what they are:
